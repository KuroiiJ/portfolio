				Story

			<p>
			I usually start a self-introduction by saying: it all began when I watched Star Wars for the first time in kindergarten, 
			and that it's been pretty much… that ever since. Since you're on my site, I'll assume you want to know a bit more than that.
 
			<br/> <br/>  
			Coming from years spent at start-ups, I’m comfortable owning large and small projects and collaborating with various teams 
			to ensure their completion. Before beginning to code a project, I heavily invest in planning. From clarifying 
			specifically which problems are being solved, designing a functional and scalable system, through to mapping 
			out a clean user experience. I aim to avoid code debt by being smart and intentional about the process. Taking the time 
			to ask and discuss questions and possible problems up front is a time investment that I want to take.
