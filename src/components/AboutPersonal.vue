							Have a Voice
						</h3>
						<p>
							Problems are not solved by hiding from them, and questions can't be answered if you don't ask. If you're in a conversation, you're there for a reason and shouldn't hesitate to contribute. Every voice is important.

							Bring Passion

							Be Agile
						</h3>
						<p>
							My approach to life is to have a bias towards action. Rather than waste time dreading something, I'd rather get it done or figure out what I need in order to get it done.

							Invest in Inclusivity

						<p>
						The more diverse voices are heard at the table, the better a company will be - Full Stop. I deeply believe that teams that have a proven commitment to creating an inclusive space, perform and hire better.
