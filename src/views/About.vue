				Pitch?

			</h2>
			<p>
			After several years working near exclusively with developers, focused on marketing a developer tool to developers, and attending developer events;
			I realized that somewhere along the way I'd developed a desire to step into the world I'd been auditing.

							Have a Voice
						</h3>
						<p>
							Problems are not solved by hiding from them, and questions can't be answered if you don't ask. If you're in a conversation, you're there for a reason and shouldn't hesitate to contribute. Every voice is important.

							Be Agile
						</h3>
						<p>
							My approach to life is to have a bias towards action. Rather than waste time dreading something, I'd rather get it done or figure out what I need in order to get it done.

							Invest in Inclusivity

						The more diverse voices are heard at the table, the better a company will be - Full Stop. I deeply believe that teams that have a proven commitment to creating an inclusive space, perform and hire better.
