				Story

			</h2>
			<p>
			I usually start a self-introduction by saying: it all began when I watched Star Wars for the first time in kindergarten, and that it's been pretty much… that ever since. But, since you're on my site, I'll assume you want to know a bit more about me as a software engineer. 
 
<br/> <br/>  
Coming from years spent at start-ups, I’m comfortable owning large and small projects and collaborating with various teams to ensure their completion. Because of that, before even beginning to code a project, I invest in planning. From figuring out specifically what problems are being solved, working out a functionable and scalable system design, through to mapping out a clean user experience. I aim to avoid code debt by being smart and intentional about the process. Taking the time to ask and discuss questions and possible problems up front is a time investment that I want to take.
 
<br/> <br/>  
 
When it gets to it, I care about writing high quality, human readable, and DRY code. There’s a unique enjoyment that comes from code that makes debugging possible and limits human error. Going along with this, I also immerse myself in exploring multiple methods of solving the same problem, and understanding the circumstances for when each option is optimal. I like to have opinions, and a strong understanding of why coding choices are made. A huge part of being an engineer is having an instinct for the best way to solve challenges, and for finding the right tools for the job.
